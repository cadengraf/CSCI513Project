# Mobile App for an Online Bookstore
This project is a Android mobile application that implements a simple database-driven bookstore using an embedded SQLite database.
The app is developed in Android Studio. 

The app supports one system admin and multiple customers, allowing book management, customer registration, purchasing, and viewing stored data. 
All data is stored permanently using SQLite and persists across application restart.
